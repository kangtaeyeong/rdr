   <h1>LYRICS</h1>
   <h2>2002 - Anne-Marie</h2>     
   [Verse 1]<br>
I will always remember<br>
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather<br>
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better<br>
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven<br>
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present<br>
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever<br>
Well, I guess that was true<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods 
On an old Mustang, where we sang <br>
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this, say<br>

[Chorus]<br>
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>


[Verse 2]<br>
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen<br>
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need<br>
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods <br>
On an old Mustang, where we sang <br>
Songs with all our childhoods friends<br>
And it went like this, say<br>

[Chorus]<br>
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods 
On an old Mustang, where we sang <br>
Songs with all our childhoods friends
Oh, now<br>


[Chorus]<br>
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love<br>
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love<br>
   I will always remember
   The day you kissed my lips
   Light as a feather<br>
   And it went just like this
   No, it's never been better<br>
