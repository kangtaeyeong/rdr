   <h1>LYRICS</h1>
   <h2>Beliver - Imagine Dragons</h2>     
  First things first<br>
  I'm a say all the words<br>
  inside my head<br>
  I'm fired up<br>
  and tired of the way<br>
  that things have been oh ooh<br>
  The way that things<br>
  have been oh ooh<br>
  
  Second thing second<br>
  Don't you tell me<br>
  what you think that I could be<br>
  I'm the one at the sail<br>
  I'm the master of my sea oh ooh<br>
  The master of my sea oh ooh<br>
  
  I was broken from a young age<br>
  Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
  Writing my poems for the few<br>
  That look at me took to me<br>
  shook to me feeling me<br>
  Singing from heartache<br>
  from the pain<br>
  Taking my message from the veins<br>
  Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
  Seeing the beauty through the<br>
  
  Pain
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain
  You break me down<br>
  and build me up <br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain
  oh let the bullets fly<br>
  oh let them rain<br>
  My life my love my drive<br>
  it came from<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Third things third<br>
  Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
  All the hate that you've heard<br>
  has turned your spirit<br>
  to a dove oh ooh<br>
  Your spirit up above oh ooh<br>
  
  I was choking in the crowd<br>
  Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
  Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
  Hoping my feelings<br>
  they would drown<br>
  
  But they never did ever lived<br>
  ebbing and flowing<br>
  Inhibited limited<br>
  Till it broke open and rained<br>
  down<br>
  It rained down like<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You break me down<br>
  and build me up <br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  oh let the bullets fly<br>
  oh let them rain<br>
  My life my love my drive<br>
  it came from<br>
  
  
  Pain<br>
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Last things last<br>
  By the grace of the fire<br>
  and the flames<br>
  You're the face of the future<br>
  the blood in my veins oh ooh<br>
  The blood in my veins oh ooh<br>
  
  But they never did ever lived<br>
  ebbing and flowing<br>
  Inhibited limited<br>
  Till it broke open and rained<br>
  down<br>
  It rained down like<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You break me down<br>
  and build me up <br>
  believer believer<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  oh let the bullets fly<br>
  oh let them rain<br>
  My life my love my drive<br>
  it came from<br>
  
  Pain<br>
  You made me a<br>
  you made me a<br>
  believer believer <br>
